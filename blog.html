        <h2>Teachable Machine</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 19th, 2022</p>

            Today in class we were tasked with creating a teachable machine that could accomplish a 
            goal. We used the site 'Teachable Machine',  which is a form of Machine Learning (a 
            subsection of AI). In the teachable machine, the computer is able to recognize different 
            images, poses, and audios and is able to tell the difference between all of them.

            For my specific project, me and my partner Sophia decided to create a teachable machine 
            with the goal of reading different people's emotions. We were able to track the emotions
            happy, sad, angry, shocked, thoughtful, and nuetral.

            Outside of teachable machine, I think AI can be used for a multitude of things. One simple 
            example is how when your typing out a message sometimes the phone suggests words to finish your
            statement based on previous messages you've typed. Another example is speech recognition.
            AI can also be used for more complicated objectives like navigating Mars.
