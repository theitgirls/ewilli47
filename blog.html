        <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 21st, 2022</p>
        <p>
            In class today we learned about Citizen Science and the work citizen scientists do. 
            Citizen science is the practice of public participation and collaboration in scientific 
            research to increase scientific knowledge. Through citizen science, people share and 
            contribute to data monitoring and collection programs. We were split into groups and had 
            to create a pesentation about an existing or new citizen science project. My partner and
            I did ours on a project about solar jets that shoot off of the sun. It was really cool
            to learn about. We used the website Zooniverse to find out about our project, which is
            a website that people can post about their projects and others can join in.
        </p>

        <h2>Tech Scavenger Hunt</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today everyone participated in a scavenger hunt around campus. For the hunt, we were split
            into groups of two or three and we had to go around campus interviewing different people
            in different departments about how they use technology and data in their careers. My
            personal favorite interview was with Mike McGrath, an admissions officer for the college.
            He recongized me from the college prep workshop he held the day before and I felt that we
            were able to have a good conversation. In his department, they get lots of data for all 
            the different students applying, and they use updated technology to be able to shift 
            through all the data. He also mentioned how they use technology from years and years ago 
            to improve their current systems. It really shows how technology is full circle.

        <h2>Teachable Machine</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today in class we were tasked with creating a teachable machine that could accomplish a 
            goal. We used the site 'Teachable Machine',  which is a form of Machine Learning (a 
            subsection of AI). In the teachable machine, the computer is able to recognize different 
            images, poses, and audios and is able to tell the difference between all of them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For my specific project, me and my partner Sophia decided to create a teachable machine 
            with the goal of reading different people's emotions. We were able to track the emotions
            happy, sad, angry, shocked, thoughtful, and nuetral.

        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of teachable machine, I think AI can be used for a multitude of things. One simple 
            example is how when your typing out a message sometimes the phone suggests words to finish your
            statement based on previous messages you've typed. Another example is speech recognition.
            AI can also be used for more complicated objectives like navigating Mars.
