        <h2>Compelling Charts</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 26th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            What makes a chart compelling? That's what I will be discussing with you today.

        <h2>Bias or Bust</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 25th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today in class, we did played a game called 'Bias or Bust'. It was a game that helped 
            us learn how to analyze our sources of bias. We were divided into two teams, Team Defend
            and Team Debunk. We had to defend or debunk different statements that were provided to 
            us by presenting different sources. One example is we had to convince a five year old 
            kid if the Earth was flat or round. Another one was convincing a college stundet if they 
            should stay in America for college or go to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
            We tailored our statements based on who we were talking to. When we were talking to a 
            five year old kid, we used pictures because that's what a kid would understand. However 
            for a college student, we were able to use sources that had explanations they would 
            understand. Different news sources were able to help us with this because we were able 
            to bring up statistics from surveys or reports.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was really cool learning about all the different types of biases and I realized I 
            didn't even know about some biases that I naturally have.

        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 22nd, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today we had a speaker come in and tell us a little about cybersecurity. Cybersecurity
            is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
            It ensures networks, devices, critical systems, sensitive information, data, and more is 
            protected from certain threats. A few threats cybersecurity fights include phishing,
            data leaks, and ID theft. Going into a little more detail, phishing is is when targets
            are contacted by email, phone, or text message by someone posing as a legitamite 
            institution to get people to release sensitive information. Data leaks and ID theft on
            the other hand are more self explainatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            I see the field of cybersecurity expanding in the future, especially as we see continue
            to see how widely technology is growing. New types of technology means new threats that
            will need to be combatted. I think the systems and skills used when it comes to 
            cybersecurity will improve in the near future but coming with that is the improvement
            of the skills hackers possess. The threats we see today aren't threats people predicted
            would occur years ago, so I think the same circle will continue into the future. Threats 
            come out of nowhere and we always need to be on the lookout for it. In the meantime,
            keep fighting cybercrime!

        <h2>Citizen Science</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 21st, 2022</p>
        <p>
            In class today we learned about Citizen Science and the work citizen scientists do. 
            Citizen science is the practice of public participation and collaboration in scientific 
            research to increase scientific knowledge. Through citizen science, people share and 
            contribute to data monitoring and collection programs. We were split into groups and had 
            to create a pesentation about an existing or new citizen science project. My partner and
            I did ours on a project about solar jets that shoot off of the sun called Solar Jet Hunters.
            Summarizing the project, an organization has been collecting data on these solar jets, but 
            the technology isn't always that accurate so the citizen scientist come in and find their 
            own solar jets in hopes of finding more efficient technology for data analysis. It was 
            really cool to learn about. We used the website Zooniverse to find out about our project,
            which is a website that people can post about their projects and others can join in.
        </p>

        <h2>Tech Scavenger Hunt</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today everyone participated in a scavenger hunt around campus. For the hunt, we were split
            into groups of two or three and we had to go around campus interviewing different people
            in different departments about how they use technology and data in their careers. My
            personal favorite interview was with Mike McGrath, an admissions officer for the college.
            He recongized me from the college prep workshop he held the day before and I felt that we
            were able to have a good conversation. In his department, they get lots of data for all 
            the different students applying, and they use updated technology to be able to shift 
            through all the data. He also mentioned how they use technology from years and years ago 
            to improve their current systems. It really shows how technology is full circle.

        <h2>Teachable Machine</h2>
        <p>Erica Williams / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today in class we were tasked with creating a teachable machine that could accomplish a 
            goal. We used the site 'Teachable Machine',  which is a form of Machine Learning (a 
            subsection of AI). In the teachable machine, the computer is able to recognize different 
            images, poses, and audios and is able to tell the difference between all of them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For my specific project, me and my partner Sophia decided to create a teachable machine 
            with the goal of reading different people's emotions. We were able to track the emotions
            happy, sad, angry, shocked, thoughtful, and nuetral.

            to check out the project
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of teachable machine, I think AI can be used for a multitude of things. One simple 
            example is how when your typing out a message sometimes the phone suggests words to finish your
            statement based on previous messages you've typed. Another example is speech recognition.
            AI can also be used for more complicated objectives like navigating Mars.

            Siri is a type of AI:
