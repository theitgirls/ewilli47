            <h1>Erica Williams' Biography</h1>
            <h2>Personal Info</h2>
            <p>
            Hey everyone! My name is <strong>Erica</strong> (pronouns she/her) and I'm from Chicago, IL! I'm a rising 
            junior at Whitney Young and as of now I'm interested in the engineering, technology, and 
            business fields. I'm still not completely sure on what I want to do in the future, which is 
            part of the reason why I decided to take this class in hopes of exploring more of my options.
            My uncle's in cybersecurity so I was interested in learning more about that field along with
            all the little subsections that can fall under information technology. 
            </p>

            <p>
            A few things I like to do in my free time are playing volleyball and just hanging out with 
            my friends. I love adventures and traveling, especially when a trip to an amusement park is 
            included. I also like to read, especially mystery and thriller books. I just finished the 
            book '14 Ways to Die' by Vincent Ralph and would totally recommend. I also love watching 
            Netflix, one of my favorite shows at the moment is probably 'You'. 
            </p>

            <p>
            That's all from me for now, feel free to come up and talk to me anytime!
            </p>
